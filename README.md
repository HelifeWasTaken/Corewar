## The arena
Matches are played by a **V**irtual **M**achine featuring:
  - A circular memory buffer of **4096** bytes
  - A CPU with:
      - An instruction set of 16 operations
      - 16 32bit registers labelled from `r1` to `r16`
      - a **z**ero **f**lag (`zf`) whose state depends on the result of some instructions
  - A round-robin **process** scheduler

Each process has:
  - A **p**rogram **c**ounter (`pc`) that moves around in memory and point to specific memory locations
  - Its own set of register values
  - Its own `zf` value

## Match setup
Each player is assigned a unique 32bit **identifier**.
Champions are loaded in memory at equally spaced offsets.
Each champion is assigned a starting **process** which has:
  - Its `pc` set to the location of the champion's first byte
  - Its `zf` set to `0`
  - Its `r1` register set to its player's identifier
  - All of its other registers set to `0`

## Execution
The game is *turn*-based.
Turns are called **cycle**s and correspond to a pass of the process scheduler.
Every cycle, the scheduler gives a fixed amount of CPU time to each process sequentially, in the reverse order that they were spawned.

Running processes can be in either one of two states:
  - `Idle`: Waiting to decode an instruction
  - `Executing` an instruction: Waiting for a sufficient amount of CPU time to finish its execution

When an `Idle` process is given a cycle worth of CPU time, it attempts to decode the byte pointed by its `pc`:
  - If the byte is a valid instruction **opcode**, it starts `Executing` it
  - Otherwise it stays `Idle` and the `pc` is moved to the next byte in memory

When an `Executing` process is given its last required cycle worth of CPU time, it attempts to decode the rest of the instruction pointed by its `pc`:
  - If the instruction is valid, it is **executed** and the `pc` is incremented by the decoded size
  - Otherwise it goes back to an `Idle` state and the `pc` is moved to the next byte in memory

## Win condition
The VM periodically performs a **live-check**.
The number of cycles before a live-check is determined by a `check interval` value which is initialized to `1536`.
During a live-check:
  - Every process that didn't execute at least one `live` instruction since the last live-check is **killed**
  - The `check interval` is decreased by `50` if either:
      - The total number of `live`s among all the processes is `‚â• 21`
      - `10` consecutive live-checks had a number of `live`s `< 21`

The match ends when all processes are killed.
The winner is the last player who has been reported alive.

‚ö† Processes can report any player to be alive, not exclusively their champion's player. See the `live` instruction for more information.

## Instruction set
The VM supports 16 instructions.
Instructions take between **1** and **3** parameters.
Parameters can be one of three types:
 - `Register`: one of the 16 registers available
 - `Direct`: an immediate numeric value
 - `Indirect`: a pointer offset to a location in memory. the offset is applied to the executing process' `pc` and the result is used to address a 32bit value in memory.

‚ö† For most instructions that perform addressing, the *reach* is limited, in which case the `pc` offset is wrapped within a `(-512, 512)` ring using a modulo operation. The only three instructions that have unlimited reach are referred to as **long** instructions.

Every instruction has an `opcode` and executes in a certain number of cycles.
Some instructions can take different types of parameters and therefore need an additional **p**arameter **c**ode **b**yte (`pcb`) when encoded (more details in the encoding section).
Some instructions have 16bit `Direct` values instead of 32bit.

The table below summarizes all those characterics for every instruction:

| mnemonic | opcode | cycles ‚è± | param 1 | param 2 | param 3 |  pcb  | Direct size |

üìù **R** = `Register` **D** = `Direct` **I** = `Indirect`

Some instructions can affect the zero flag `zf` by either reading or computing a value. If the value is zero, `zf` is set to `1`, otherwise it is set to `0`.

Detailed behaviors for every instruction:
<hr/>

`live` *id* | ‚è±10

Reports this process **and** the player #`id` as being alive.
<hr/>

`ld` *src, dst* | ‚è±5

*Load*s `src` in the register `dst`. `src`'s value affects `zf`.
<hr/>

`st` *src, dst* | ‚è±5

*Store*s `src`'s register value in `dst` (either a register or a memory location).
<hr/>

`add` *lhs, rhs, dst* | ‚è±10

Computes `lhs + rhs` and stores the result in the register `dst`. The result affects `zf`.
<hr/>

`sub` *lhs, rhs, dst* | ‚è±10

Computes `lhs - rhs` and stores the result in the register `dst`. The result affects `zf`.
<hr/>

`and` *lhs, rhs, dst* | ‚è±6

Computes `lhs & rhs` and stores the result in the register `dst`. The result affects `zf`.
<hr/>

`or` *lhs, rhs, dst* | ‚è±6

Computes `lhs | rhs` and stores the result in the register `dst`. The result affects `zf`.
<hr/>

`xor` *lhs, rhs, dst* | ‚è±6

Computes `lhs ^ rhs` and stores the result in the register `dst`. The result affects `zf`.
<hr/>

`zjmp` *offset* | ‚è±20

Moves the process' `pc` by `offset` **only** if the process' `zf` is set to `1`.
<hr/>

`ldi` *lhs, rhs, dst* | ‚è±25

Computes `lhs + rhs` and uses the result as an offset to address memory and load a 32bit value into the register `dst`.
<hr/>

`sti` *src, lhs, rhs* | ‚è±25

Computes `lhs + rhs` and uses the result as an offset to address memory and store the value of the register `src` at that memory location.
<hr/>

`fork` *offset* | ‚è±800

*Fork*s this process. This effectively creates a new process that inherits the current process' registers and `zf`. The spawned process has its `pc` set to his parent's `pc` offseted by `offset`.
<hr/>

`lld` *src, dst* | ‚è±10


The **long** version of **ld**.
<hr/>

`lldi` *lhs, rhs, dst* | ‚è±50

The **long** version of **ldi**. Neither the parameter values nor the computed address will have their reach limited. Contrary to **ldi**, the value loaded from memory affects `zf`.
<hr/>

`lfork` *offset* | ‚è±1000

The **long** version of **fork**
<hr/>

`aff` *chr* | ‚è±2 (not yet implemented, subject to change)

Makes this process' champion talk by displaying `chr`'s value. This instruction is useful if you want to ridicule your opponents.
<hr/>


## Writing champions
Champions consist of bytecode generated from compiling programs written in the VM's assembly language.

### The assembly language
A champion's program consist of:
 - A name
 - A description
 - A sequence of instructions

The champion's name and description are set using the `.name` and `.comment` directives respectively.
Instructions and directives are each placed on a single line, empty lines are allowed, token spacing works with any number of whitespaces and you can start line comments by using the `#` character
To create a champion called "John Cena", you could for instance start your program by writing:
```
.name    "John Cena"          # Champion's name
.comment "And his name is..." # Champion's description
```

Instructions are composed of a **mnemonic** followed by comma (`,`) separated parameters
 - `Register` parameters are valid register numbers prefixed by a `r` character. (e.g: `r12`)
 - `Direct` parameters are numbers (or labels, see below) prefixed by a `%` character. (e.g. `%1337`)
 - `Indirect` parameters are standalone numbers (or labels, see below). (e.g. `42`)

An instruction that *xor*s the memory value at offset 42 with the number 1337 and stored it in the 12th register could be written:
```
xor  42, %1337, r12    # r12 = mem[pc+42] ^ 1337
```

Instructions can be optionally preceded by **labels**.
Labels are references to locations in your code. They can be used in parameters to help with offset computation and code readability.
A label is declared as a colon (`:`) **suffixed** alphanumeric identifier, and referenced with its identifier **prefixed** by a colon.
An infinite live loop could look like:
```
loop: live %1         # Stay alive
      and  r1, %0, r1 # Set zf = 1 to make sure the next zjmp takes effect
      zjmp %:loop     # Jump back to the start of the loop
```
When compiling this program, `%:loop` is treated as `%-13` (the `live` and the `and` instructions are respectively 5 and 8 bytes long when encoded here)
